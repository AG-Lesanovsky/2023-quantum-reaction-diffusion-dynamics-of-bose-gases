Quantum Reaction-Limited Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics of Noninteracting Bose Gases
</h1>

This repository contains figure data and code implementation of the paper 'quantum reaction-limited reaction-diffusion dynamics of noninteracting Bose gases' (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04018).

The data to create figures can be found in the results folder. The code to create the figures can be found in the source-code (src) folder. There are two python scripts, one containing the code used to create the phase diagram (Fig. 6 in the paper) (phasediagram.py, qrd_dynamics.py) 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

## Usage

- `git clone https://github.com/AG-Lesanovsky/2023-quantum-reaction-diffusion-dynamics-of-bose-gases`
